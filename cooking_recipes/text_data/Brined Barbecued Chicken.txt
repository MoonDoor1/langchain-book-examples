Recipe name: Brined Barbecued Chicken

Number of servings: 2

Ingredients:
  2 unit Boneless chicken breasts
  4 tablespoon Soy sauce
  4 tablespoon White wine
  2 tablespoon Vegetable oil
  2 tablespoon Cornstarch

Directions: Mix together all of the sauce ingredients. Put half the sauce in a large pan of cold water, add two additional tablespoons of salt, and stir. Add the chicken and store in the refrigerator overnight. Before barbequeing, remove the chicken from the brine solution and pour half of the sauce (made the day before) over chicken, coating the chicken on all sides. Put the chicken on your barbeque (charcoal or gas grill works fine). Brush the sauce over the top of the chicken and grill for about 10 minutes, then turn over and apply more barbeque sauce on the top Be careful to not burn the chicken. Before removing from the grill, cut into a thick piece and make sure it is done. NOTE: it is important to use cold water for brining and immediately refrigerate the brine after adding the chicken.
