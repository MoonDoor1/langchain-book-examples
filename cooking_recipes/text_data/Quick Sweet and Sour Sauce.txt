Recipe name: Quick Sweet and Sour Sauce

Number of servings: 8

Ingredients:
  1 cup White vinegar
  2/3 cup Sugar
  2 tablespoon Ketchup
  2 tablespoon fresh ginger
  1/4 teaspoon Salt
  1/4 teaspoon Tabasco sauce

Directions: Use a medium size pan to combine the vinegar, sugar, ketchup, ginger, salt and tabasco sauce and bring to a boil under high heat. Cook until the sauce is reduced to a fairly thick sauce. You don't want the sauce to be runny but you also don't want it to be too thick. Pay attention while cooking the sauce!
