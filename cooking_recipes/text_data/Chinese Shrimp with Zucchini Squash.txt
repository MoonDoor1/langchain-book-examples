Recipe name: Chinese Shrimp with Zucchini Squash

Number of servings: 2

Ingredients:
  14 medium-large medium shrimp
  1 tablespoon Cornstarch
  1/2 teaspoon Salt
  1/2 teaspoon Pepper
  2 cup Zucchini
  2 tablespoon Oil
  1 tablespoon Sherry
  1 tablespoon Soy sauce

Directions: I vary the proportion of shrimp to Zucchini squash depending on both my tastes and how much shrimp and Zucchini I have on-hand that I want to use up. Shell and chop the shrimps into three or four pieces and roll in cornstarch, salt and  pepper - use a small bowl for this. Wash the zucchini and coarsely chop. Heat the oil in a non-stick pan and fry Zucchini until it is mostly done before adding the shrimp and the sherry. When the shrimp are done then mix in the soy sauce and serve immediately. Note: I like to eat this dish as-is but you might want to also try serving it with cooked Chinese style noodles or even a small amount of cooked Italian pasta.
