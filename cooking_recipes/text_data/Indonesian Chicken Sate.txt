Recipe name: Indonesian Chicken Sate

Number of servings: 4

Ingredients:
  4  Skinless, boneless chicken breast halves (about 1 1/2 pounds)
  1/4 cup Reduced-sodium soy sauce
  1  Fresh lemon juice
  1 tablespoon Dark molasses
  1 teaspoon Red Pepper Flakes
  1 tablespoon Garlic Powder Granules
  1 tablespoon Ginger

Directions: Cut breasts into long 1 inch strips. Put the chicken and all of the other ingredients into a large bowl and mix well making sure the chicken is well coated. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for two hours or longer. Stir up the bowl a few times while the chicken is marinating. You can use either a (gas or charcoal) grill or the broiler in your oven to cook the Sate. Optional: skewer the chicken strips on wet bamboo skewers - or you can cook the chicken loose if you don't have skewers. Broil or grill  about 4 minutes on each side, occasionally applying more marinade. Optional: if you have any available, serve with Indonesian or Thai peanut sauce, or chutney.
