Recipe name: Tasty Black Bean Dip

Number of servings: 4

Ingredients:
  1.5 cup 16-0z can black beans
  2 tablespoon Chopped red onion
  1 tablespoon Balsamic vinegar
  1  Clove garlic
  1/2 cup Olive Oil

Directions: You can use canned black beans (each 12 ounce can is about 1 1/2 cups) or cook dry beans according to package directions and then cool. Combine ingredients in the blender or food processor and mix for about 1 minute to either a fine or course consistency depending on your tastes and preferences. I like to serve this in small individual bowls place on a larger plate so there is plenty of room on each plate for pita bread, chips, and/or cut up raw vegetables.
