Recipe name: Chicken Schnitzel

Number of servings: 6

Ingredients:
  2 pounds Chicken Breasts
  4 unit Eggs
  1.5 cup Flour
  1 cup Bread Crumbs
  5 tablespoon Vegetable oil

Directions: Slice Chicken Breasts 2 parts so each piece is as large an area and thin as possible. Remove skin and any excess fat. Optional: place on a cutting board and pound flatter. Dip chicken in beaten eggs, roll in flour, then in bread crumbs. Heat oil in a (preferably nonstick) frying pan. Fry the Schnitzel on each side until golden brown and the chicken is done (cut into chicken to make sure it is cooked).
