Recipe name: Borscht

Number of servings: 4

Ingredients:
  2 cup Beets
  1  Onion
  2 clove Garlic clove
  2 quart Water
  2 teaspoon Salt
  3 tablespoon Sugar
  1/4 cup Lemon juice

Directions: Wash and peel beets and thickly slice so they cook faster. Peel the onion and garlic cloves. Leave the onion and garlic cloves whole since we will be removing them later. Mix everything except the lemon juice and sugar in a large covered pot and cook over low heat for one hour. Add the sugar and lemon juice.  Cook an additional thirty minutes, remove from heat and let cool. Discard the onion and garlic and use a hand mixer to blend into a cold soup. Optional: place a small spoonful of sour cream on top of each serving.
