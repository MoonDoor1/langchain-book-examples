Recipe name: Fresh Tomato Sauce

Number of servings: 4

Ingredients:
  12  Tomatoes
  2 tablespoon Sugar
  1 teaspoon black pepper
  1 teaspoon Salt
  1 cup Fresh basil

Directions: Place all  ingredients in heavy saucepan or dutch oven and bring to a slow boil. Lower heat  and cook covered for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. I suggest using a small amount for a meal immediately (with cooked pasta) and freezing most of it for future meals. This is a great recipe to use up extra tomatoes from your garden or when tomatoes are in season and inexpensive to buy.
