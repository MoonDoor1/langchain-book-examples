For a healthy meal I prefer using relatively few shrimp (slicing them in half lengthwise) and a lot of vegetables. Sometimes I use fewer fresh vegetables and more shrimp (and then leave the shrimp whole).\n\nThe white wine is optional. You can substitute some canned vegetable broth or water.\n\nPut half the olive oil in a heavy frying pan that has a lid (which we will use later). Heat the oil and cook the onion for about a minute before adding the chopped vegetables and then the hot chili sauce.\n\nAfter a few minutes add the finely chopped fresh garlic, give everything a good stir, and cook for another minute before adding the wine (or broth, or water). Stir again, cover the frying pan, reduce heat and slowly cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the raw shrimp, stir, cover, and cook for another 5 minutes (stirring occasionally to make sure the shrimp get cooked).\n\nIf you use pre-cooked shrimp (not really recommended) then delay adding the defrosted cooked shrimp for a few minutes. You don't want to overcook already cooked shrimp.\n\nUncover the pan and add the cooked rice.  Keeping the heat low, stir the ingredients together and cook for another few minutes. Finally, add the remaining olive oil, stir well, turn off the heat, cover the pan and let everything sit for a few minutes before serving.\n\nYou can also serve the shrimp and vegetables on top of the cooked rice instead of mixing in the rice at the end of cooking the shrimp and vegetables.\n\nI like to keep frozen raw shrimp in the freezer. This recipe works well when I have vegetables need to use up. This recipe also works well when I have left over cooked rice to use up.\n\nIf I have leftovers for this recipe I like to make another meal by heating lightly in the microwave and adding some sour cream before eating. The sour cream adds a great flavor and makes leftovers taste different.",

I cook the sauce under very low heat for about 3 hours but you can reduce the cooking time if you need to. I set an alarm to go off every 20 minutes to remind me to stir the sauce and add a little bit of water if the sauce is very thick. About 5 minutes before turning off the heat I add the final 1/3 of the olive oil to the sauce.

(Prepared mustard can be Dijon or plain yellow mustard.) My Favorite is mixing in a little of both Sriracha and Dijon mustard. Mix the Sriracha, mustard, honey, and soy sauce on a paper plate and coat the boanless and skinless chicken with this mixture. Heat the Coconut oil to medium high heat in a no-stick pan and add the chicken. Cook the chicken for about 7 or 8 minutes per side. Cut into the fattest piece of chicken to make sure it is done. Cook longer if necessary. Since this dish is flavorful and spicy, but also fairly high in fat and sugar, I like to pair this recipe with simple steamed vegetables. \u003Cb\u003EAs an appetizer:\u003C/b\u003E you can use chicken wings and make an appetizer.

Add canola oil to the non-stick pan and cook the finely sliced or chopped up ginger and carrots for two minutes - then add the onions and frozen peas and continue frying for a two minutes.
