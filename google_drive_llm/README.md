# Setup

Follow directions in the book to set up Google app authentication.

# run

```
python fetch_txt_files.py
python index_and_QA.py
```

Note: I added a directory langchain-book-examples/google_drive_llm/data that you can use if you don't want to set up Google auth, and ust want to try running index_and_QA.py
